We are committed to the continuous development of caregivers to provide the highest quality of Respite and After Care. Our caregivers go through specific training on Adult/Child Care, Emergency Response including CPR and First Aid. We are trained to recognize signs of a possible life-threatening situation and respond quickly and effectively.

##Respite Care
Our home care team and highly trained caregivers make it possible for you and your loved one to attend those life events that make life worth living. We will focus on the details needed to provide quality care so that the family can focus on the details of a quality memory in the making. Whether going out for lunch, attending a play, coffee with an old friend or attending a grand daughters wedding or a grandsons bar mitzvah our flexible home care services will keep you safely engaged in the lifestyle you choose to lead.

###24 Hour Care
With the goal of maximizing the time our clients have with their families, our continuous round-the-clock care solution focuses on comfort, safety and peace of mind for all. Flexible home care service plans cover a few hours a day or caregiver shifts around the clock that provide relief for family caregivers, including bathing, dressing and toileting, specialized personal care related to immobility, picking up prescriptions, personal shopping, and support through the end of life and grief process.

##After Care
Our After Care services are fully customizable to meet the needs of the client and provide peace of mind to loved ones who worry from afar. Our Day surgery services include driving to the surgery, treatment or procedure, taking notes to ensure conversations with medical professionals are captured, companionship and comfort, transportation home, picking up prescriptions and medications, meal preparation, and even personal care services like assistance with bathing or dressing.

Our caregivers are always discreet and follow HIPAA guidelines to ensure privacy, but equally important, they are focused on the safety and wellbeing of the patient. Itâ€™s helpful to have another set of ears to ensure that the after care or discharge instructions are understood, particularly when the patient is under the influence of pain medication, because compliance with these instructions is critical to recovery and a good outcome. Light housekeeping, grocery shopping and meal preparation for the upcoming days is often helpful.

###Hospital Discharge Services
Our hospital discharge services help get clients safely home from a facility, easing back into daily routines as health conditions allow. Hospital discharge services may include capturing and communicating discharge orders, transporting the client, picking up any over the counter or prescription medications, grocery shopping and errands, preparing and serving meals, genuine companionship, and any level of personal care such as assistance with bathing, dressing, hygiene or mobility.
