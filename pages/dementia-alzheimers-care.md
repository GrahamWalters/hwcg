Our dementia care program is designed to enrich your loved one’s lifestyle. Having a neutral caregiver, maintains the dignity and independence of the client through home care coordination. Our program also helps to de-stress the family when they learn new coping behaviors and ways to support activities of daily living. We can also integrate companion care and personal care into a customized plan designed to fit your loved one’s needs and help families cope with the challenges of memory impairment.

###Alzheimer's Care
When our Alzheimer’s caregivers help a person living with the disease the goal is not to make things harder. To that end, Homewatch CareGivers matches each caregiver specifically to each client. They go through extensive Alzheimer’s care training so they can create a peaceful environment that makes sure a client is safe and content. We work with you to craft a home care service plan. That is the first part of a process that makes sure we directly address each individual client’s Alzheimer’s care needs.

###Memory Care Program
Our team builds a dementia care plan that is individually customized for each family. We use a positive, failure-free approach which creates a calm and supportive environment to bolster your loved one’s self-esteem when they are most vulnerable. Trained caregivers find what is unique about your loved one, such as hobbies and activities they enjoy, to create meaningful moments that continue to adjust as cognitive abilities change. Pathways to Memory supports the entire family, getting them involved as well as providing them with tips and skills to be a coping solution as your loved one’s needs change.

Pathways to Memory is specialized, unique dementia care for those living with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia that keeps them safe and improves the quality of life for everyone involved. Our Dementia Care Specialist help with many daily-living activities, including bathing, dressing, personal grooming, housekeeping, transportation, and preparing healthy meals.

###Pathways to Memory

This specialized form of care features one-on-one interaction and attention and provides social interaction and companionship to the person living with dementia. Pathways to Memory keeps clients safe and improves the quality of life for everyone involved. Each in-home caregiver trained in the dementia care program uses a positive, failure-free approach that makes a calm and supportive environment to bolster self-esteem when a person is most vulnerable.
