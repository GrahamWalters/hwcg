Our caregivers go through specific training on many chronic conditions, including Diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, Stroke, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), heart disease and lung disease so we can recognize signs of a possible life-threatening situation and respond quickly and effectively. People with chronic conditions can often experience unpredictable changes in their health, but our caregivers are specifically trained to recognize and adapt to changing needs — we never get complacent. We do not work in a vacuum — we believe it’s essential to coordinate our care with medical professionals, like doctors, to make sure we are all working toward the same goal. The main focus is your safety — our caregivers work at all times to make sure the home is a safe environment, continually assessing the risk of a fall or other factors that could be dangerous for a person with a chronic condition.

### Diabetes
For someone living with diabetes, even small daily changes can make a big impact on future health and well being. Our caregivers encouraging lifestyle choices that help manage their diabetes and give them more time to enjoy with family. A critical service for those living with diabetes is healthy meal planning and preparation to promote overall health; we will take your loved one to the grocery store and encourage selections choices within their prescribed diet plan, taking into consideration their tastes and preferences. Our caregivers will report changes in a client’s condition, including foot appearances, so this information can be shared with medical.

### Parkinson's Disease
When the progression of Parkinson’s impacts activities of daily living, we understand the frustration that is felt by the entire family. We assist clients with prescribed exercise for muscular strengthening and development and alleviate the burdens often left to family caregivers such as errands, housekeeping, transportation to and from appointments, and even personal grooming assistance like bathing.

### Stroke
Let Homewatch CareGivers provide relief for you and your family with knowledgeable caregivers who understand the chronic care needs of those who have experienced a stroke. Our compassionate caregivers patiently work through your loved one’s communication difficulties to promote their dignity, preferences, and lifestyles choices. With specialized training through our Homewatch CareGivers University, our caregivers know the strategies to help promote a healthy diet and lifestyle.

### ALS or Lou Gehrigs Disease
ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease leads to muscle weakening and affects the clients ability to control voluntary movements of the muscles including those that control breathing. There is a progressive loss of ability for the patient to be independent in their care. Our caregivers can assist with mobility and transfers, plan and prepare special diets to facilitate good nutrition, and offer emotional support allowing the client enough time to communicate, always being sensitive to the preservation of the client’s dignity.

### Heart Disease
We provide support for those living with heart disease through services that include assistance with grocery shopping and meal preparation to promote a heart healthy diet. We can help monitor important health measures such as weight, blood pressure and oxygen levels, and we can provided assistance with grooming, housekeeping, errands, and transportation to and from appointments. With a caregiver keeping an eye on your loved one day-to-day and trained to report changes, we can help to reduce unnecessary visits to the hospital.

### Lung Disease
Caring for a loved one who is often short of breath and anxious can be taxing, overwhelming, and sometimes even scary. We are your long-term care partners, alleviating stress caused by these unpredictable changes. Our caregivers provide assistance adjusting to a new lifestyle with an oxygen tank, and facilitate ease of social outings and daily errands, which can alleviate family caregiver burnout.
