Homewatch CareGivers provides care for children and adults with learning disabilities and special needs. We build close one-to-one relationships with each person, ensuring their happiness, security and wellbeing – encouraging them through education, employment and recreation.

### Developmental Disabilities
Developmental Disabilities can cause severe physical or mental impairments that can slow learning, limit mobility, inhibit expression, and make the individual dependent on others for care and assistance. Without a caring and secure environment, those living with developmental disabilities are at an increased risk of compromised health and safety, and are subject to learning and developmental delays. Our caregivers are equipped to promote independence while assisting these clients with the activities of daily life.

### Autism
Homewatch CareGivers is a provider of specialist home care services to individuals with Autism or complex learning disabilities here in Howard County. Our highly trained staff really understands Autism and Learning Disability, helping each and every person we support enjoy “a life of happiness, dignity, achievement, and inclusion“. We deliver on these outcomes through our dedication and specialist focus.

### Down Syndrome
If your child or relative is living with Down syndrome, Homewatch CareGivers encourages you to foster independence — because it’s likely they’re capable of almost everything anyone else is. With the proper developmental, educational and lifestyle support, your loved one – and those who care for them — can lead a fulfilling life.

### Multiple Sclerosis
Encouragement and support from Homewatch CareGivers provides you and your family some relief as you face unique challenges during the advancing stages of Multiple Sclerosis. Our comprehensive personal care plans are customized to individual needs.
