    I would recommend Katherine and Homewatch to anybody. I have recommended them before to two other people and they have also enjoyed their services.

    I would recommend Homewatch CareGivers because the people who work for them are all very understanding, well trained, and have good personalities! They are much better than the agency that we had in the past. I think they are wonderful and I have full confidence in them!

    I would recommend this agency for home care because of the great service we have experienced. My aunt has been handled very well and this care has been exactly what my aunt has needed and it keeps her at ease, comfortable, and happy.

    My family and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the care you and your staff gave Mother over the past years. The kind, dependable care allowed her to spend her final years in HER home, which is what she wanted.

    I can't praise Dorcas enough. She is a lovely, loving lady who was dependable, honest, and went above and beyond good care of Mother. We feel so fortunate to have met Dorcas and to have had her care for Mother.

    Thank you so very much.

    Both Jerry &amp; I are VERY satisfied with the respite services provided during my recent trips. I will be sure to contact you when I need caregiver assistance again. I am in multiple caregiverâ€™s groups for stroke patients and I will be sure to recommend your company.

    Kathryn, I can't thank you enough for all the support you have given me over the years. I still remember Pete fondly. I hope he is doing well. And Greg has been wonderful too. I will recommend you to other people who might need such support. Hopefully I will not need it in the future, but of course you never know!

    Thank you for sending Susan to us! She is very reliable. It's hard to believe she's been part of our family for two years. She's cheerful, fun and very attentive with our mother; reads to her, listens to music with her, watches mom's DVDs as well as much more. We love her very much. Susan works hard with mom's personal duties and is willing to do anything asked of her.
